# startup-week - Learning to Code

- use codepen, rapid prototype enviornment, can save if they want to make a free eniovrnment

- can paste in JS, HTML and CSS to get cool things

- go over forking

## why code is important

- more and more things are being done by computers

- you might not have to code for your job but you may interact with someone who does - need to be able to communicate!

## HTML, CSS, JS (would this be too overhwelming)
- view source on a website
- developer tools
- you can see how every site on the internet is made!

## codepen

- rapid prototyping enivornment for HTML, CSS and JS
- also cool things
- can create a free account or just create an anonomys pen

- talk about forking (github forking, sharing code)

## play with codepen!

- make some text, h1, add an image?
- simple CSS
- create a button and have a click event?
- something easy in JS 

## how is this all even working
- web browser is interpreting the code written
- HTML is the structure
- CSS is the styling
- JS lets you manipulate the page (and more!)


## fork a pen
 
- create some example for them with stuff set up
- they fork it
- have them change things -> break it
- have them change things -> see the changes

## errors

- you will break code and its part of the job!
- dont be afraid of errors, the computer is just doing exactly what you told it to do, go see what you actually told it to do!
